          This directory contains test reports for both the API and Web UI components of the project.

          ## How to Open Test Reports

          ### API Test Report
          1. Navigate to the `api-test-results` directory
          2. Locate the `html-report/test-report.html` file
          3. Open this file with any web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
          4. You can simply double-click the file or right-click and select "Open with" and choose your browser

          ### Web UI Test Report
          1. Navigate to the `web-ui-test-results` directory 
          2. For coverage reports, open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in your browser
          3. This will show you detailed code coverage information for the project

          ## Notes
          - These reports provide a user-friendly way to view test results
          - The reports include information about passed, failed, and skipped tests
          - Coverage reports show which parts of the code are covered by tests and which are not
